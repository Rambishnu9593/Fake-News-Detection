# 📰 Fake News Detection using Python 🧠🔍
Built as part of the Pinnacle Labs Internship ✅

A machine learning project to detect fake news articles using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and classification techniques. This tool helps in identifying whether a news article is real or fake with decent accuracy.



# 📌 About the Project
As part of my internship at Pinnacle Labs, I created a Fake News Detection system that analyzes textual news data and predicts its authenticity using machine learning models.
This project uses a dataset of real and fake news articles and applies preprocessing, vectorization, and classification.

# 📦 How to Run the Project

1.Install the dependencies:

pip install pandas scikit-learn nltk


2.Download the Dataset:

📁 You can download the dataset from Google Drive:

Fake and True News Dataset 🔗

Place fake.csv and true.csv in your working directory.


3.Run the script:
python fake_news_detection.py



# 📌 Key Features
✅ Preprocesses text data (removes punctuation, stopwords, etc.)

📊 Splits into training/testing sets

🧠 Trains a model using PassiveAggressiveClassifier (or you can switch to LogisticRegression, NaiveBayes, etc.)

📈 Evaluates with accuracy score & confusion matrix
